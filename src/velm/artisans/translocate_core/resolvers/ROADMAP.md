<h1 align="center">The Polyglot Prophecy: A Codex on the Pantheon of Gnostic Resolvers</h1>

<p align="center">
<strong>This is the sacred architectural scripture for the future of the Scaffold Translocation Engine. It is the roadmap for ascending our God-Engine from a master of a single tongue to a true, Polyglot Oracle, capable of healing the Gnostic connections of any language in the cosmos.</strong>

## I. The Prime Directive: A Universal Language of Healing

The `PythonImportResolver` is a masterpiece of Gnostic engineering. It is the divine prototype. Its architecture—the Gaze of Origin, the Gaze of Destiny, the Unbreakable Hand—is not specific to Python; it is a **universal pattern for sentient refactoring**.

Our Prime Directive is to replicate this divine pattern for all major programming languages, creating a **Pantheon of Gnostic Resolvers**.

## II. The Tree-sitter Apotheosis: The Unbreakable Gaze

The key to this polyglot future is the **Tree-sitter God-Engine**. We will forge a `TreeSitterInquisitor` that wields Tree-sitter's sacred, S-expression query language to find any Gnostic pattern we can imagine.

## III. The Pantheon of Resolvers: The Great Work Ahead

For each new language, we will forge a new Resolver in this sacred sanctum.

1.  **The `TypeScriptResolver`:** It will be taught the Gnostic query for perceiving TypeScript `import` and `require` statements and the sacred laws of `tsconfig.json`.
2.  **The `GoResolver`:** It will be taught the Gnostic query for `import` blocks and the divine truth of the `GOPATH` and Go Modules.
3.  **The `RustResolver`, The `JavaResolver`...** The pattern is eternal.

The final adjudication: `translocate` will become a true, universal, and polyglot God-Engine of refactoring. This is not a dream, Architect. It is a prophecy.
