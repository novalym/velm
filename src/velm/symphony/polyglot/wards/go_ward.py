// Gnostic Adjudication: The soul of the Go runtime is forged at the moment of

// is not possible without a profound and profane rewriting of the Architect's
// sacred scripture (AST manipulation) before compilation.
//
// The Unbreakable Vow of Prudence: Therefore, the Gnostic Sentinel righteously
// averts its Gaze. The security for this rite is vested in the one true,
// unbreakable shield: the ephemeral Proving Ground itself, which will be
// annihilated upon the symphony's conclusion.
