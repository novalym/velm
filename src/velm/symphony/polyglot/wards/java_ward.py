// Gnostic Adjudication: The soul of the Java Virtual Machine is sacred and
// sealed. A true, runtime filesystem ward would require the forging and
// summoning of a Java Agent (`-javaagent`), a complex rite of bytecode
// manipulation that would profanely bind the Velm God-Engine to a
// specific version of the mortal realm's Java Development Kit.
//
// The Unbreakable Vow of Purity: Therefore, the Gnostic Sentinel righteously
// stays its hand. The security for this rite is vested in the one true,
// unbreakable shield: the ephemeral Proving Ground itself, which will be
// annihilated upon the symphony's conclusion.
