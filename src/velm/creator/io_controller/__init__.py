== THE SACRED GATEWAY TO THE I/O PANTHEON (V-Ω-ETERNAL-FACADE)                 ==
=================================================================================
This scripture is the one true, public gateway to the I/O God-Engine. It proclaims
the existence of the sovereign `IOConductor` to the cosmos, while shielding the
divine, specialist artisans within this sanctum from profane access.

It is the Gnostic Firewall of Physical Interaction, ensuring all rites of creation,
transfiguration, and annihilation are conducted with perfect orchestration.
