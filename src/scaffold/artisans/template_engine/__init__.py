# LIF: ∞ (THE UNBREAKABLE PUBLIC CONTRACT)
#
# This scripture is now the one true, public gateway to the Template God-Engine.
# It proclaims the existence of the sovereign `TemplateEngine` Conductor from its
# new, sacred sanctum within `engine/`, preserving the unbreakable Gnostic
# contract with the rest of the cosmos.
#
# The Heresy of Implementation Leakage is annihilated. The architecture is pure.
